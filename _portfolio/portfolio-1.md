- The Problem

In the midst of the ongoing pandemic, numerous patients are encountering significant challenges when it comes to accessing hospital facilities and receiving timely ambulance services. Compounding the issue, ride-sharing companies have been forced to suspend their operations, leaving their riders in a difficult position where they are unable to fulfill their needs and earn a livelihood.

- The Solution

To tackle these pressing issues, I present a business solution known as "2wheelance," which introduces a portable ambulance system. This innovative system consists of a motorbike and a detachable carriage that serves as an ambulance for transporting patients. Equipped with an adapted mattress and an oxygen cylinder, the carriage is designed to cater to the specific needs of patients. Additionally, the ambulance will be equipped with a comprehensive primary health kit to further support patient care.

- Leveraging Ride-Sharing Providers

A key aspect of this solution revolves around leveraging existing ride-sharing providers and their established networks. By focusing on these ride-sharing companies, which have both riders and users, we can tap into their user base and streamline the process of connecting patients with ambulance services. Through a dedicated app, users can easily communicate with available riders. Through a partnership with ride-sharing companies, riders can quickly attach the ambulance carriage to their bikes, enabling them to provide prompt and efficient ambulance services.

- Benefits and Impact

The implementation of the 2wheelance portable ambulance system brings forth numerous benefits and positive outcomes. Ride-sharing providers, who have been struggling due to the pandemic, now have an opportunity to earn income by offering essential ambulance services. Simultaneously, patients no longer have to endure the consequences of limited access to healthcare facilities. They can rely on the efficient and timely transportation provided by the 2wheelance system, ensuring that they receive the necessary medical attention without delay.

By successfully deploying this innovative solution, we aim to address the pressing need for accessible healthcare transportation, create viable business opportunities for ride-sharing providers, and ultimately enhance the overall well-being and safety of patients during these challenging times.
