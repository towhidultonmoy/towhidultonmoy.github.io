In this pandemic crisis,   it has been seen that many patients are facing trouble going to hospitals. They are not getting an ambulance facility in time. On the other hand, most of the operations of the ride-sharing companies are postponed. Riders can not go out on the road, thus they are facing problems fulfilling their needs. They are not getting any money & are unable to fulfill their demands. They are starving for lack of income. Sharing rides were their only source of income.

I have come with a solution. Here I propose a portable ambulance system naming 2wheelance. The system consists of a motorbike and a carriage which will act as an ambulance to carry patients. It has a ‘sidecar’ with an adapted mattress attached to it and equipped with an oxygen cylinder. The carriage is portable so that it can easily be plugged & removed. The ambulance will be equipped with a primary health kit to facilitate the patients. I am also focusing on the ride-sharing providers. I am focusing on ride-sharing companies because they have both the riders & users. The users can get contact with the riders by using the app. Being covenanted with the ride-sharing companies, the riders just have to plug the carriage with their bikes & they are all ready to go. By establishing this facility, both the users & the providers will be benefitted. The riders will be able to earn some money during this pandemic. No patients will suffer for not able to go to the hospital. I have given the design details.
