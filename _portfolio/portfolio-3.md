##  The Problem

Tata Communication recognizes the importance of digital transformation across various sectors, such as Cloud and Data Centre, Business Collaboration, Managed Security, Network, Mobility, Voice, and Media. To expedite this transformation journey, the challenge lies in projecting the business potential for each of the 3915 regions within the dataset over the next 12 months.

## The Solution

In response to this challenge, I successfully developed forecasting algorithms utilizing pytorch's "temporal fusion transformer." These algorithms proved highly effective in predicting the potential data for 3915 regions over a span of 72 months, covering the subsequent 15 months. The competition spanned two rounds, where I consistently demonstrated exceptional performance.

In the first round, my forecasting algorithm yielded a remarkable MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) score of 748.8268, securing an impressive 4th position. Building on this success, I further improved my results in the second round, achieving an outstanding MAPE score of 566.9499. This achievement propelled me to the 2nd position in the competition.

## Benefits and Impact

By employing advanced forecasting techniques, such as the temporal fusion transformer, I have unlocked the potential to predict business outcomes for Tata Communication across a diverse range of regions. This allows for informed decision-making and strategic planning, enabling the company to allocate resources effectively, identify growth opportunities, and streamline their digital transformation efforts. The accuracy and precision of these forecasting algorithms provide invaluable insights that drive business growth, enhance operational efficiency, and ultimately contribute to the success of Tata Communication's digital transformation initiatives.
