##  The Problem

During the COVID-19 crisis, our country has witnessed a distressing situation where patients are losing their lives due to the chaotic process of seeking medical care. Patients are often forced to rush from one hospital to another, only to find that the treatment facilities in those hospitals are temporarily suspended. This creates a frustrating cycle of searching for available healthcare options, causing delays in receiving timely treatment. Moreover, hospitals frequently require patients to provide specific documents, including proof of a negative COVID-19 status, further complicating the process. The lack of information about hospital conditions and the challenge of accessing necessary resources, such as oxygen cylinders, exacerbate the suffering of patients.

Additionally, doctors themselves face the risk of contracting the coronavirus as patients may hide their COVID-19 illness, putting the medical staff at increased risk.

## The Solution

To address these critical issues, I propose the development of a comprehensive app equipped with essential features to streamline the patient experience and improve access to appropriate healthcare. This app will include a list of nearby hospitals, providing information about their available facilities and services. It will also provide guidance on the necessary documents required for treatment and maintain a central database of COVID-19-affected patients. To facilitate identification, the app will include a "corona badge" feature for individuals to easily communicate their COVID-19 status.

One of the app's standout features is the "Emergency" option, which incorporates an AI-powered chatbot to assist patients. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the app will identify the most suitable hospitals based on the patient's specific illness, ensuring efficient and effective care. The UI design has been completed, and the development process is currently underway.

## Benefits and Impact

By implementing this app, we aim to revolutionize the patient experience during the pandemic crisis. Patients and their attendants will have access to crucial information about nearby hospitals, ensuring they make informed decisions regarding their medical care. The app's central database of COVID-19-affected patients will help healthcare providers better manage and monitor the spread of the virus. The availability of necessary documents and the corona badge feature will simplify hospital admission processes, reducing confusion and saving valuable time for both patients and medical staff. Ultimately, the AI-powered chatbot will provide immediate assistance in emergency situations, offering crucial support and guidance to patients in need.

Through the development of this app, we strive to improve patient outcomes, enhance the efficiency of healthcare delivery, and alleviate the challenges faced by both patients and healthcare providers during these unprecedented times.
